maps contain:
{filepath, transform, c++ func?}

How would I for example place a player character with move functionality inside of a scene?
obviously the character's location needs to be remembered somewhere...
and the code can either be compiled as a dll or inside the binary. probably just inside the binary but uh... kinda weird.
