### frame_counter
Imagine keeping a good eye on performance while developing, that would be pretty neat, no?

TODO I'd really like to have the game automatically detect: "oh shit the fps average is way below the previous example." But that sounds annoying in practice.

``cargo run -p frame_counter --release``
